I've often seen customer support individuals need help to meet customer and business expectations.  If you think back to your onboarding time, you likely watched videos about the product and reviewed the top 10 issues you might encounter for the application or service you're supporting.  Then you are sent off to solve customer issues.  But the training covered less than 20% of customer problems, and your manager is pressuring you (unrealistically) to solve more tickets.  

Hopefully, you pushed through that stage, but now you need help to advance to the next level.  The source of your trouble is not that you need to be better or intelligent enough.  It would help if you had the tools to enhance your learning and help guide you to improve or even recognize where you should improve.  Ongoing training needs to be improved at best and non-existent at worst, so you need a new way to increase your skills and knowledge.

Complexity will scale along with the size of your organization.  Priorities change week to week, and focus shifts all the time.  What we can do is use a system to focus on getting better.  You can get that promotion.  You can be someone your coworkers rely on when things get tough.  You can be that subject matter expert.  

Below is the 4 step structured approach to solving customer issues.  We can use it to reduce organizational complexity and focus on becoming better faster.

## Step 1.  Understand the Problem

How can you solve their issue if you don't know what the customer is asking?  Many customer support team members rush past this step and deliver inadequate responses to the customer.  Often pushing that customer into an agitated state because they've lost faith in the person being able to provide relevant support.  They start wondering if they need to talk to someone else or if the support representative will ever resolve their issue.

Questions to answer before continuing to the next step:

* What data do you have?
* What is unknown?
* What is the desired outcome?
* Who's affected by the issue?
* Where are they interacting with your service (API, UI, SMS, Other)?
* Can you paraphrase the issue?

## Step 2.  Research

Now that we understand the problem, we can begin to research what that issue is.  Sometimes the case comes with a clear error message.  Other times you might get an incoherent rambling of symptoms.  You must filter through the noise and find vital information.

Questions to ask before continuing to the next step:

* Do you need more information?
* What assumptions are there?  Are those assumptions relevant and valid?
* Is this similar to other problems you have solved?
* Have you leveraged all the resources available to you?
* Can this problem be broken into smaller bites?
* Can you reproduce this issue?
* What are the unstated asks?


## Step 3.  Deliver

You've done all the research and are ready to deliver the message to the client.  Many technical support organizations don't deliver messages empathetically and come off as rude or dismissive.  Each contact with the customer needs to be at the highest level you can provide.

Questions to ask before continuing to the next step:

* Did you greet them by name?
* Did you paraphrase the issue or recognize their feelings?
* If you asked them to do something, did you explain why?
* Did you explain the research you did?
* Did you practice next issue avoidance?

## Step 4.  Reflect

Customer support is usually so busy that reflection and learning are skipped in favor of jumping to the next customer issue.  But the best way to scale is to scale up the knowledge on your team.  Reflection is the secret sauce that allows you to solidify what you've learned and process how you can do better next time.

Questions to ask before finishing:

* How could the next person find the solution faster?
* Did you miss any assumptions?
* Did you miss a next issue avoidance opportunity?
* If you had to advance it, what did the person who solved it see that you didn't?
* What did you learn?
