Hi!

I’m a technical support professional with 8+ years of excellence supporting  SMB, mid-market and enterprise customers. I have the ability to grasp complex technical concepts and translate those concepts into an understandable language for end-users and team members.  During my interactions with technical and non-technical customers, I have proven my ability to perform well under pressure with excellent leadership, innovative thinking, fast learning capabilities, customer service and problem-solving skills.  

 
With my Python and Data Analysis skills, I enjoy analyzing customer data to find ways to tell stories about our users’ activities.  These stories lead to actionable strategies for key decision-makers.

### Support Engineering Coaching

I coach and educate support engineers on how to respond to customers in an accurate, professional, and timely matter.  I also outline performance management and professional development.

### Support Operations

I evaluate and implement solutions into the support workflow.  The solutions can be a third party or an in-house solution.  I design educational and training materials.

### Support Analytics

I can identify key metrics for the support team as well as uncover actionable insights related to customer activity and distribute that information to sales, marketing, and product.
