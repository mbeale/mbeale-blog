Hi!

I aim to help 1 million technical support engineers reach their maximum potential.  I have over ten years of experience working with SMBs and fortune 500 customers.  Below are ways I can help organizations get the most from the support team.

### Structured Support 

I coach and educate support engineers on how to develop their skills.  My 4-step structured problem-solving method can take an inexperienced support engineer to support hero in less than half the expected time.  

* Understand the Problem
* Research
* Deliver
* Reflect

### API Support Engineering

I can help develop support engineers to be an escalation point for API-related projects.  They can help your clients integrate with your API with less involvement from engineering. 

### Engineering Support Enablement

I can outline tools for engineering to provide support.  Deflect the maximum amount of tickets to keep engineering working on features instead of chasing down customer issues.   Enable the support engineers to help you.

### Support and Product

Where can collaboration with support benefit the product team?  Improve communication and productivity to generate more revenue and keep more customers happy.
