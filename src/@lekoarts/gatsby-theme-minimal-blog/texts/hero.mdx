  Hi.

I've seen customer support organizations and individuals struggle to meet customer expectations.   Some of the struggles I see are:

* Inexperienced support team members not providing quality responses
* The customer support team doesn't understand customer issues
* Badly formatted responses
* High amounts of reopened tickets
* Low customer satisfaction
* Engineering is swamped with tickets that don't require code fixes
* Long training/onboarding process
* Unable to ask relevant probing questions
* Customer support team members are unable to advance to the next level

I've developed a system to overcome all the above challenges and get your customer support organization and team members to add value to the overall customer experience.

## Step 1.  Understand the Problem

How can you solve their issue if you don't know what the customer is asking?  Many customer support team members rush past this step and deliver inadequate responses to the customer.  Often pushing that customer into an agitated state because they've lost faith in the person being able to provide relevant support.  They start wondering if they need to talk to someone else or if the support representative will ever resolve their issue.

Questions to answer before continuing to the next step:

* What data do you have?
* What is unknown?
* What is the desired outcome?
* Who's affected by the issue?
* Where are they interacting with your service (API, UI, SMS, Other)?
* Can you paraphrase the issue?

## Step 2.  Research

Now that we understand the problem, we can begin to research what that issue is.  Sometimes the case comes with a clear error message.  Other times you might get an incoherent rambling of symptoms.  The support team must filter through the noise and find vital information.

Questions to ask before continuing to the next step:

* Do you need more information?
* What assumptions are there?  Are those assumptions relevant and valid?
* Is this similar to other problems you have solved?
* Have you leveraged all the resources available to you?
* Can this problem be broken into smaller bites?
* Can you reproduce this issue?
* What are the unstated asks?


## Step 3.  Deliver

You've done all the research and are ready to deliver the message to the client.  Many technical support organizations don't deliver messages empathetically and come off as rude or dismissive.  Each contact with the customer needs to be at the highest level you can provide.

Questions to ask before continuing to the next step:

* Did you greet them by name?
* Did you paraphrase the issue or recognize their feelings?
* If you asked them to do something, did you explain why?
* Did you explain the research you did?
* Did you practice next issue avoidance?

## Step 4.  Reflect

Customer support is usually so busy that reflection and learning are skipped in favor of jumping to the next customer issue.  But the best way to scale is to scale up the knowledge on your team.  Reflection allows team members to solidify what they learned and process how they can do better next time.

Questions to ask before finishing:

* How could the next person find the solution faster?
* Did you miss any assumptions?
* Did you miss a next issue avoidance opportunity?
* If you had to advance it, what did the person who solved it see that you didn't?
* What did you learn?
