I'm Michael - A technical support professional with 8+ years of excellence supporting  SMB, mid-market and enterprise customers. I have the ability to grasp complex technical concepts and translate those concepts into an understandable language for end-users and team members.  During my interactions with technical and non-technical customers, I have proven my ability to perform well under pressure with excellent leadership, innovative thinking, fast learning capabilities, customer service and problem-solving skills.  

 

With my Python and Data Analysis skills, I enjoy analyzing customer data to find ways to tell stories about our usersâ€™ activities.  These stories lead to actionable strategies for key decision-makers.
